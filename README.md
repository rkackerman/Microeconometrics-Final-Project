Microeconometrics-Final-Project
===============================

Here you will find the final version and supporting files for a project I completed in a graduate level course in microeconometrics.  The project titled "Using the American Community Survey to Explore the Employment-to-Population Ratio Puzzle of the Great Recession".  Here is the full abstract:

"This paper seeks the reconcile the disparity in signals of the health of the labor market sent by the unemployment rate and the employment-to-population ratio following the 2007- 2008 recession in the United States. Following previous recessions, these labor market moved in tandem as the labor market recovered. However, following this most recent recession the unemployment rate signaled a recovering labor market while the employment-to-population ratio signaled a stagnant labor market. Using data from the American Community Survey (ACS) I employ a Oaxaca-Blinder style decomposition to show that the changing demographics help to reconcile these apparent mixed signals."

This repository contains the following files:

1. ECON873Projectv2.pdf is the main written document that is the most detailed presentation of my research.
2. ECON873Projectv2.tex is a LaTeX file the produces 1.
3. Econ873 Presentation.pdf is a slide deck used during a presentation of my research, generated in Powerpoint
4. Ackerman_ECON873_Project_v2.do is the main STATA file detailing the methods used in producing 1.
5. Econ873_Final_Project_Ackerman_v2.log is a STAT log file detailing the successful execution of 4.


Note: The data used in this research is not posted.  This is mainly because the file is over 3GB, and I didn't think it was necessary to include as the data is readily accessible via the Minnesota Population Center here: https://usa.ipums.org/usa/index.shtml
